Scenario-Based Prompt Engineering Report for MediGuide
Objective
To demonstrate the use of various prompting techniques—zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, and multi-modal prompts—in optimizing MediGuide’s responses for real-world use cases involving elderly patients managing diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis.

Use Case 1: Daily Health Advice (Zero-Shot Prompting)
Scenario:
An elderly user with hypertension asks:
"What should I eat today to manage my blood pressure?"

Prompt:
“What are some recommended dietary tips for a person with high blood pressure?”

Response (Zero-shot):
“For managing high blood pressure, it’s best to eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy. Reduce sodium intake, avoid processed foods, and drink plenty of water. Foods rich in potassium like bananas and spinach can also help.”

Effectiveness:
Straightforward and effective for simple queries, especially when no prior context is given.

Use Case 2: Personalized Medication Reminder (Few-Shot Prompting)
Scenario:
MediGuide needs to remind patients to take medications based on past patterns and preferences.

Prompt:
User Query: "What medicines should I take this morning?"
Few-shot Examples:

User: “What medicine should I take tonight?”
MediGuide: “At 8 PM, you should take Amlodipine 5mg for blood pressure and Metformin 500mg for diabetes.”

User: “What’s my afternoon dose?”
MediGuide: “At 1 PM, take 1 tablet of Metformin 500mg with food.”

Actual Prompt: “What medicines should I take this morning?”

Response (Few-shot):
“At 8 AM, you should take 1 tablet of Amlodipine 5mg and 1 tablet of Metformin 500mg with breakfast. Please have a glass of water and avoid caffeine right after.”

Effectiveness:
Improves consistency by learning from prior examples. Best for routines.

Use Case 3: Complex Symptom Explanation (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)
Scenario:
The patient reports unusual symptoms like fatigue and dizziness.

Prompt:
“I’ve been feeling dizzy and tired lately. What’s wrong with me?”

Chain-of-thought prompting:
“Let’s consider possible reasons. Dizziness and fatigue can be caused by low blood pressure, low blood sugar, dehydration, or medication side effects. Since you are on Amlodipine and Metformin, these symptoms could relate to your medications or diet.”

Response:
“Let’s analyze this. Dizziness and fatigue may be caused by low blood sugar due to Metformin or a side effect of Amlodipine lowering your blood pressure too much. Did you skip a meal or take extra medicine? I recommend checking your blood sugar and pressure and contacting your doctor if this continues.”

Effectiveness:
Encourages step-by-step reasoning, useful in triaging complex inputs.

Use Case 4: Emotional Support and Motivation (Role-Based Prompting)
Scenario:
A user says they feel discouraged about their health.

Prompt:
“You are a friendly and empathetic digital health assistant. Your goal is to comfort elderly users and gently motivate them.”

User: “I feel like I’m not getting better. This is exhausting.”

Response:
“I understand it can be really hard. You’ve been doing your best, and every small step counts. Managing your health takes time, and I’m here for you every day. Let’s set one simple goal today—maybe a short walk or a healthy meal. You’ve got this!”

Effectiveness:
Human-like empathy through persona emulation helps improve user morale.

Use Case 5: Exercise Guidance Using Visual Inputs (Multi-Modal Prompting)
Scenario:
A user wants help with a knee-friendly arthritis workout by uploading an image of a yoga mat and resistance bands.

Prompt:
Text Input: “Can you suggest a gentle exercise for arthritis with this setup?”
Image Input: (photo of yoga mat and resistance bands)

Response (Multi-modal):
“Great setup! With your mat and bands, you can try seated leg lifts or gentle resistance band stretches for your knees. These reduce stiffness and improve flexibility. I can show you a 3-minute guided video if you like.”

Effectiveness:
Combines image understanding with tailored advice—ideal for context-aware interaction.
